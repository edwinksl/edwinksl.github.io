This website uses the [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) static site generator, uses a custom domain and is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

The `source` branch contains the source code for the website. The `master` branch contains the content of the `output` directory created by `make github` using Pelican. The `master` branch is not needed for Netlify because Netlify is responsible for [building and deploying](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/) the website.
